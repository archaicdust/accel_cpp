Write a program to generate a cross-reference table
that indicates where each word occurs in the input.

xref

In the xref argument list,
find_words defines a **function parameter**

For example,
we could pass the find_urls function from ch6,
and use the cross-reference function to see where URLs apper in the input.

In this example,
we use split as a default argument.

We already wrote split fuction in ch6

    $ ln -s ../../ch6/split/src/split.cc .
    $ ln -s ../../ch6/split/include/split.h .
